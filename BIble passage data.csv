year the Lord will continue to bless you more and [Music] more Isaiah 3: 10 say ye to the righteous that he shall be well with him I want you to prophesy to one or two people and say he shall be well with you,Isaiah 3:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of you are not doing it to remember the law of a glory ahead now what is Glory we already know the meaning according to Proverbs 3:35 Proverbs 3 ver 35 the wise shall inherit,Proverbs 3:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools the opposite of the wise is fools so the opposite of Glory is shame so Glory ahead is actually saying no more shame for you,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because in Joel chapter 2 verse verses 26 and 27 Joel 2 26- 27 twice the Lord repeated himself saying my people shall never be ashamed please help me prophesy to somebody remember my son who spoke told,Joel 2:26-27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you this a night of Faith with faith prophesy to the fellow next you will never know shame again and then turn the to the people on the other side and prophesy to yourself I said I will never know shame again,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now ah heard means somewhere in the future you know the life of a man is broken into three pieces the past the present and the future yesterday today and,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomorrow and according to Hebrews chapter 13:8 Hebrews 13:8 it tells us that Jesus is in control of all three Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so I heard me somewhere in future somewhere you are yet to [Music] reach so Glory,Hebrews 13:8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahead means something beautiful something worthwhile in the future and that's why Isaiah 3: 10 says say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him in the himym that we sang the special song for,Isaiah 3:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tonight if you look at verse 7 there he says something he said when something is in the hand of the one whose name is Omega things can only get better whatever my situation right now I know,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my tomorrow will be all right because in the hands of the Omega things can only get better I decree to someone straight away whether the devil likes it or not your tomorrow will be all right the future [Music] will be better than the,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
present for several reasons one the fact that you are still breathing means there is hope for you Ecclesiastes 9:4 Ecclesiastes 9:4 be declare when there is life there is hope a living dog is better than a dead,Ecclesiastes 9:4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lion am I you might look at me and consider me to be a dog now right now and I'm not dead yet and my future is not in your hand my future is in the hand of Omega my future is in the hand of the one who controls tomorrow you know that is what in Psalm,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

finisher of your faith just focus on him Colossians 1:27 Colossians 1:27 made it clear Christ in you the hope of glory I want to assure you it doesn't matter how sick you are,Colossians 1:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now if you are see breathing you shall be well how come because your healing have been paid for First Peter 2: 24 first Peter,1Peter 2:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:4 before he said that by his stri you were healed he says Jesus Christ had already born your sin on the TRU somebody had paid for your healing so it doesn't matter what the devil may be telling you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ since you are still,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
